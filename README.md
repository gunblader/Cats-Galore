# Cats-Galore

This is a general template for an Angular Web-app(without back-end).

The htmls that we are going to write for Phase 1 are going to be similar to those in /partials. 

**NOTE:  We’re referencing all of our vendor dependencies (e.g. Bootstrap, jQuery, Angular) at outside URLs.   Therefore, it is necessary to host our site while we’re working on it.  Be sure we are viewing it in a browser with http:// -- not file://**
